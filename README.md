# The Hidden Emissions of Electric Vehicles 
### 2023 MIMS Capstone Project by Astoria Ho, Clara Hu, Josh Everts

Our project, **The Hidden Emissions of Electric Vehicles**, examines the sustainability of zero emissions vehicles and highlights barriers to EV adoption and use in California. Through an interactive website and vehicle emissions tool, called Emissions Explorer, we break down how and why EVs still emit, and let people explore how different factors – charging location, vehicle type, and mileage – all impact emissions. 

Our Emissions Explorer allows a user to input almost any vehicle (gas, hybrid, or electric) and outputs the lifetime emissions of that vehicle, along with useful context about how that vehicle compares to its peers. We built our emissions model calculations using data from the GREET model, created by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and vehicle emissions and weight data from the EPA. Emissions Explorer models the production, use, and end-of-life emissions for a vehicle, and is the first tool to integrate these calculations into a digestible, consumer-facing product. 

The **Hidden Emissions of Electric Vehicles and Emissions Explorer**, were ideated, designed, and built by three students from the School of Information at UC Berkeley as a capstone project for the Master of Information Management and Systems program.

### How to use the tool
Navigate to the [Emissions Explorer](https://eee-capstone.github.io/MIMS-Capstone/vehicleForm/vehicle_form.html), and enter a year, make and model for a vehicle you're interested in learning more about. Then, enter a zip-code and how long you expect to own or drive the vehicle for and press submit! We will calculate an emissions estimate for your vehicle that looks something like this:

### More about our tool
We use the GREET life cycle analysis module, developed by Argonne National Laboratory as the basis for our emissions calculations. In addition, we use vehicle and emissions information from the EPA. More about our data sources and model assumptions is located in the report below.
